# bootloader__Pic16f887
All the code in this repository is based on the AN1310 application note included in the project folder. 
All the information needed in order to implement and use a bootloader in a 16f887 microcontroller is explained in that document but all you need is to compile the project, load the .hex file onto the pic microcontroller (that code is the bootloader) and then load applications written in mplab using the bootloader to load that code through the serial port
